# House Prices Prediction

This project was developed as part of the **Machine Learning** course at **Afeka Academic College of Engineering**.  
It aims to predict house prices using various machine learning techniques.  

The project currently includes:
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- A baseline model using Linear Regression.

### Future Improvements
This project is a work in progress. Planned improvements:
- Implementing and comparing multiple models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
- Hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
- Feature engineering to create more meaningful predictors.
- Adding detailed visualizations (residual plots, feature importance, etc.).
- Improving documentation and code structure.

### Dataset
The dataset is based on the **House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques** dataset from Kaggle, containing various features about residential homes (size, location, quality, etc.) to predict their sale price.

### Goal
To build and evaluate machine learning models for predicting house prices, analyze feature importance, and gain insights into which factors most affect property values.
